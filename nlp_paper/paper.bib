Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.",

abstract = {Abstract A huge number of informal messages are posted every day in social network sites, blogs, and discussion forums. Emotions seem to be frequently important in these texts for expressing friendship, showing social support or as part of online arguments. Algorithms to identify sentiment and sentiment strength are needed to help understand the role of emotion in this informal communication and also to identify inappropriate or anomalous affective utterances, potentially associated with threatening behavior to the self or others. Nevertheless, existing sentiment detection algorithms tend to be commercially oriented, designed to identify opinions about products rather than user behaviors. This article partly fills this gap with a new algorithm, SentiStrength, to extract sentiment strength from informal English text, using new methods to exploit the de facto grammars and spelling styles of cyberspace. Applied to MySpace comments and with a lookup table of term sentiment strengths optimized by machine learning, SentiStrength is able to predict positive emotion with 60.6\% accuracy and negative emotion with 72.8\% accuracy, both based upon strength scales of 1â€“5. The former, but not the latter, is better than baseline and a wide range of general machine learning approaches.},

In the literature, several deep and complex neural networks have been proposed for this task, assuming availability of relatively large amounts of training data. However, the associated computational complexity increases as the networks go deeper, which poses serious challenges in practical applications. Moreover, it was shown recently that shallow word-level CNNs are more accurate and much faster than the state-of-the-art very deep nets such as character-level CNNs even in the setting of large training data. Motivated by these findings, we carefully studied deepening of word-level CNNs to capture global representations of text, and found a simple network architecture with which the best accuracy can be obtained by increasing the network depth without increasing computational cost by much. We call it deep pyramid CNN. The proposed model with 15 weight layers outperforms the previous best models on six benchmark datasets for sentiment classification and topic categorization.",

Since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed at different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still presents major difficulties. A statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.},

abstract = "With the rapid proliferation of Web 2.0, the identification of emotions embedded in user-contributed comments at the social web is both valuable and essential. By exploiting large volumes of sentimental text, we can extract user preferences to enhance sales, develop marketing strategies, and optimize supply chain for electronic commerce. Pieces of information in the social web are usually short, such as tweets, questions, instant messages, messages, and news headlines. Short text differs from normal text because of its sparse word co-occurrence patterns, which hampers efforts to apply social emotion classification models. Most existing methods focus on either exploiting the social emotions of individual words or the association of social emotions with latent topics learned from normal documents. In this paper, we propose a topic-level maximum entropy (TME) model for social emotion classification over short text. TME generates topic-level features by modeling latent topics, multiple emotion labels, and valence scored by numerous readers jointly. The overfitting problem in the maximum entropy principle is also alleviated by mapping the features to the concept space. An experiment on real-world short documents validates the effectiveness of TME on social emotion classification over sparse words."
