# NLP-Project-Emotion-Analysis
This project aims to investigate the emotion and sentiment from a set of publicly open dataset and test various commonalities for identifying of the emotion.

The repository contains standalone executable builds for Windows and Linux. Both have shortcuts in the root folder.

The user interface for Mac is currently available by installing the libraries specified in requirements.txt and running "fbs run" in the console at the project folder.
Note that these are only dependencies of the GUI. The different training scripts have their separate dependencies.

The flask app for model serving is available here: https://github.com/loerssoni/emotion_model_serve
